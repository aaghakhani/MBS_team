      title: "Welcome to Microrobotic Biomedical Systems group ðŸ‘‹"
      text: |
        We engineer intelligent microrobots for biomedical applications in targeted drug delivery,Â microsurgery, detoxification, and diagnostics by advancing micro- and nanofabrication asÂ well as ultrasound technologies. To realize their full potential, medical microrobots have toÂ master locomotion in complex biofluidic environments, wireless actuation and control,Â precise imaging and localization, or effective drug/cargo delivery. We overcome theseÂ challenges by incorporating biologically-inspired adaptive capabilities into microroboticÂ agents and utilize lab-on-a-chip and microfluidic systems to validate biological andÂ therapeutic functions. We thus bridge the gap between biomedical research and clinicalÂ applications to propel medical microrobots to the forefront of modern healthcare.
